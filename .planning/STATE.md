## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: @noir-lang/backend_barretenberg is deprecated; must use @aztec/bb.js instead
- [Roadmap]: Garaga v1.0.1 tested on Noir beta.16, project uses beta.18 -- Day 1 spike validates compatibility
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (Proof Engine SDK) can overlap with Phases 3-4 since it only needs Phase 2 circuit artifacts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Garaga v1.0.1 compatibility with Noir beta.18 is unvalidated -- fallback is downgrading to beta.16
- [Phase 1]: nargo beta.18 ACIR artifacts with noir_js beta.15 -- 2-version gap may cause issues
- [Phase 5]: @aztec/bb.js Poseidon2 and Schnorr TypeScript APIs assumed but not confirmed
