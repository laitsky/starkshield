<objective>
Create the demo video script and DoraHacks submission draft, then guide the user through recording, uploading, deploying, and submitting -- the human-only tasks that complete the hackathon submission.

Purpose: The user needs a precise script to record an efficient 3-minute demo, and pre-written submission text to paste into DoraHacks. This plan prepares both documents, then checkpoints for the human actions.
Output: Demo script, DoraHacks submission draft, verified demo video, completed BUIDL submission

    # StarkShield Demo Video Script (3 minutes)

    ## Pre-Recording Checklist
    - [ ] ArgentX/Braavos configured for Sepolia with funded STRK (~5 STRK)
    - [ ] `cd sdk && npm run dev` running at localhost:5173
    - [ ] Browser window sized to 1920x1080
    - [ ] Do one full proof generation first to warm WASM (discard result)
    - [ ] Clear localStorage (fresh dashboard)
    - [ ] Close all other tabs, disable notifications
    - [ ] OBS/QuickTime ready to record

    ## Script

    ### 0:00 - 0:15 | Problem Statement (text overlay)
    Show a title card or text overlay:
    "Every on-chain identity check today forces users to reveal their private data.
    StarkShield fixes this: prove who you are without revealing who you are."

    ### 0:15 - 0:30 | Architecture (show README diagram)
    Open the GitHub repo README. Scroll to the Architecture section showing the Mermaid diagram.
    Text overlay: "Client-side ZK proofs + Garaga-generated Cairo verifiers = fully on-chain, trust-minimized verification"

    ### 0:30 - 1:00 | Credential Wallet
    Switch to the running app (localhost:5173 or Vercel URL).
    Show the Credential Wallet view with loaded demo credentials.
    Click on the age credential card -- show the details (issuer, attribute, expiration).
    Text overlay: "Credentials are loaded and stored locally -- nothing leaves your device"
    Click "Generate Proof" to navigate to Proof Generator.

    ### 1:00 - 1:45 | Age Proof Generation
    In the Proof Generator view:
    1. Show the credential is pre-selected
    2. Set age threshold (e.g., 18)
    3. Click "Generate Proof"
    4. Show the real-time progress indicator (circuit compilation, witness generation, proof generation)
    5. When proof completes, show the public output preview
    Text overlay: "Proof generated entirely in your browser via WASM -- no backend"
    6. Click "Submit On-Chain"
    7. ArgentX/Braavos popup appears -- approve the transaction
    8. Show the transaction confirmation with Starkscan link

    ### 1:45 - 2:15 | Verification Dashboard
    Navigate to the Verification Dashboard.
    Show the new verification record: truncated nullifier, attribute (age >= 18), timestamp, tx link.
    Click the Starkscan link to show the on-chain event.
    Text overlay: "Verifiable on-chain -- any dApp can query the result by nullifier"

    ### 2:15 - 2:40 | Membership Proof (quick second demo)
    Go back to Credential Wallet. Select the membership credential.
    Generate a membership proof (fast since WASM is warm).
    Submit on-chain.
    Show both verifications on the Dashboard.
    Text overlay: "Multiple credential types, same trust-minimized pipeline"

    ### 2:40 - 3:00 | Closing
    Text overlay or GitHub README scroll:
    "StarkShield -- Privacy-preserving credential verification on Starknet
    Noir circuits | Garaga verifiers | Cairo contracts | Browser WASM proofs
    github.com/[REPO_URL]"

    ## Post-Recording
    1. Trim dead air from start/end
    2. Add text overlays (or record with them via OBS text sources)
    3. Export as MP4 (H.264, 1080p, 30fps)
    4. Upload to YouTube as Unlisted
    5. Title: "StarkShield - Privacy-Preserving Credential Verification on Starknet"
    6. Description: Brief description + GitHub link + hackathon mention
    7. Verify link works in incognito browser
    ```

    **2. Create dorahacks-submission.md** with pre-written submission content:

    # DoraHacks BUIDL Submission -- StarkShield

    ## Project Name
    StarkShield

    ## One-Liner
    Privacy-preserving credential verification on Starknet -- prove who you are without revealing who you are.

    ## Track
    Privacy

    ## Project Description (250+ words)

    StarkShield is a privacy-preserving credential verification protocol built on Starknet that lets users prove specific attributes about themselves -- such as age eligibility or group membership -- to on-chain smart contracts and dApps without revealing any underlying personal data.

    The core technical innovation is a complete zero-knowledge verification pipeline that operates entirely client-side: Noir circuits define the verification logic (signature checking, expiration enforcement, threshold comparison, set membership), bb.js generates UltraKeccakZK Honk proofs in the browser via WASM, and Garaga-generated Cairo verifier contracts validate these proofs on-chain. The StarkShieldRegistry contract serves as the trust layer, managing trusted issuers, enforcing nullifier uniqueness to prevent double-use, and logging verification records that any downstream dApp can query.

    What makes StarkShield unique in the Starknet ecosystem is its focus on identity privacy rather than transaction privacy. While projects like Mist.cash handle private transfers and Tongo handles confidential ERC-20 operations, StarkShield fills the identity verification gap -- enabling use cases like age-gated DeFi, KYC-compliant protocols, and membership-restricted DAOs, all without requiring users to expose personal data on-chain.

    Key technical achievements:
    - Two production-ready Noir circuits (age verification at 1,224 ACIR opcodes, membership proof at 1,253 opcodes) with Poseidon2-Schnorr signature verification
    - Garaga-generated Cairo verifiers deployed on Starknet Sepolia with on-chain verification costing approximately 2.25 STRK per transaction
    - Complete browser-based proof generation via noir_js and bb.js WASM (no backend required)
    - Per-dApp context-specific nullifiers ensuring cross-dApp unlinkability
    - React SPA with real-time proof generation progress, public output preview before submission, and verification dashboard with Starkscan transaction links

    The protocol is designed for composability: any Starknet dApp can integrate with StarkShield by querying the registry contract, enabling a shared trust-minimized identity layer across the ecosystem.

    1. Follow the script in `.planning/phases/08-demo-submission/demo-script.md`
    2. Record at 1080p 30fps using OBS or QuickTime
    3. Upload to YouTube as Unlisted
    4. Verify link works in incognito

    **Step 4: Update README.md placeholders**
    1. Replace `VIDEO_URL` with YouTube link
    2. Replace `VERCEL_URL` with Vercel deployment URL
    3. Push updates

    **Step 5: Submit to DoraHacks**
    1. Go to https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/redefine
    2. Create a BUIDL submission
    3. Copy content from `.planning/phases/08-demo-submission/dorahacks-submission.md`
